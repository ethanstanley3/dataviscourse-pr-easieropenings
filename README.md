Non-obvious features of visualization:

    Hover over any element of the visualization to see the move highlighted on the other two components of the visualization.
    Make a move on the board, click a row of the table, or click a wedge of the pie chart to change the board state being visualized.
    Click a header of the table to sort the rows by that attribute.
    Use the dropdown in the top left to filter the games being visualized by the rating of the players.
    To return to the starting board state, click the "Restart" button.
    Drag a piece to a new location without releasing it to see which row of the table/wedge of the pie chart correspond to that move.
