Project Peer Feedback

Feedback Providers: Audrey Miller, Marni Epstein, Michael Eyer

Feedback Receiver: Ethan Stanley

Feedback:
- Limiting how deep the analysis can go to avoid problems with sparse data
- How to fix moves that are too uncommon (e.g. group them into one block of “rare” moves)
- It is interesting to intermediate chess players (target audience)
- Good data and scope
- Chess board should at least display the current position if not interactive (move this from “nice to have” to “essential” feature)
- The circle thing is cool
- Scales well, is not size dependent (more data is better)
- Plan is detailed
- Interesting: never seen filtering based off of rating
- Color is not super necessary
- Use color to differentiate moves (color is effective for categorical data)
- Extra feature: incorporate a chess engine
- The expanding pie chart is meaningful
- Chess board and pie are synchronized (they think this is effective)
